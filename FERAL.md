If I tell you you are on a bug duty, what I want you to do is to go to GitHub to your own repository, take a look at all issues reported and start fixing them one by one. Make each issue in a separate branch and push them to GitHub. I will open pull requests myself for review.
If I tell you fix build issues, what I want you to do is to go to the GitHub repo, look at ci runs and fix any broken tests or builds and then commit. I will push changes myself.
