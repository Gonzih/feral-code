This agent tool is not fully implemented in this version. In the full Feral Code implementation, this would:

1. Launch a new stateless agent instance
2. Provide the agent with access to all available tools:
   - Bash, Glob, Grep, LS, Read, Edit, MultiEdit, Write
   - NotebookRead, NotebookEdit, WebFetch, TodoRead, TodoWrite
   - WebSearch and other specialized tools
3. Execute the following task autonomously:

${prompt}

The agent would:
- Perform the task independently without further user input
- Use tools as needed to complete the objective
- Return a single comprehensive result
- Handle errors and edge cases automatically

To implement this fully, you would need:
1. A way to spawn new AI model instances
2. Tool orchestration and execution framework
3. Result aggregation and reporting system
4. Proper isolation and resource management

For now, you can break down this task and use individual tools manually to achieve the same result.`;
